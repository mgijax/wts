</CENTER><P>
The Configuration.py module will instantiate a Configuration object named
config when it is imported.  All modules (and cgi) which import Configuration
should reference this object rather than creating one of their own.  (to save
effort spent creating many Configuration objects as needed)<P>
The Configuration.py module also initializes the <a name="dbInit">db</a> module
when it is first imported.<P>

<B><a name="QueryProcess">How do TrackRec queries become result
screens?</a></B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
The process by which we go from a query form to a result set form is really
quite convoluted, but we'll take a shot at explaining it below...
<PRE>
    Query Form
	|
	| sends filled-in query fieldnames (in nice_fieldname form)
	| and values to...
	|
    tr.query.results.cgi
		|
		| produces a Raw_Query_Dict which is then passed to...
		|
	TrackRec.validate_Query_Form
		|
		| produce a Clean_Query_Dict which is then passed to...
		|
	TrackRec.build_And_Run_SQL
		|
		| converts fieldnames to be in database_fieldname
		| format, and then uses the dictionary to build and
		| run a query.  This produces a list of dictionaries,
		| which is sent to...
		|
	TrackRec.parse_And_Merge
		|
		| converts fieldnames back to nice_fieldname format, and
		| collects values into a Result_Set with one row per
		| tracking record.  This Result_Set is then processed...
		|
	by tr.query.results.cgi to produce the table in the TR Query
	Result Summary Screen

<B><a name="Dicts">TrackRec Dictionaries</a></B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
Dictionaries are heavily used throughout the code for the TrackRec class,
especially in the class methods.  Each can be thought of as a new data
type, though we won't implement them that way at this point.  They are
named and defined below, to save confusion in the TrackRec definition:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=5>
	<TR><TH>Name<TH>Description
	<TR><TD>Raw_TR_Dict
		<TD>input dictionary of attribute -> string value mappings for
		a TrackRec object.  All attribute names and values have not
		yet been validated.  (Attribute names are of the object
		fieldname format)
	<TR><TD>Clean_TR_Dict
		<TD>dictionary of attribute -> string value mappings for a
		TrackRec object.  All attribute names and values have been
		validated.  (Attribute names are of the object fieldname format)
	<TR><TD>Raw_Query_Dict
		<TD>dictionary of attribute -> value mappings from the Query
		Form.  These attribute names and values have not been validated.
		(Attribute names are of the object fieldname format)  Probably
		will not contain all possible tracking record attributes.
	<TR><TD>Clean_Query_Dict
		<TD>dictionary of attribute -> value mappings from the Query
		Form which have been validated.  (Attribute names are of the
		object fieldname format)  Probably will not contain all possible
		tracking record attributes.
	<TR><TD>Query_Row_Dict
		<TD>dictionary of attribute -> value mappings for a single
		row returned by a query.  Since these come from the database,
		we know that all attribute names and values are valid.
		(Attribute names are of the database fieldname format)  A
		Query_Row_Dict will not necessarily contain all the fields
		for a single tracking record, but rather only those requested
		in the query.
