<LI><B>Record Locking and Key Assignment need to be atomic operations</B><P>

This is a general problem within MGI.  We need to ensure that we can do a
"select", a test, and an "update" as a single operation when assigning
keys or locking records.  Once the group finds a general solution, we will
need to update WTS code in:
	<UL>
	<LI>TrackRec.py : lock (), unlock ()
	<LI>WTS_DB_Object.py : allocate_Key ()
	</UL>

<P>
<LI><B>Names of help files are hard-coded</B><P>

We are tying hard-coded filenames in TrackRec.py (HELP_FILES) to files which
are expected to be in the file system.  If we need to change one of these
filenames, then we need to change the value in:
	<UL>
	<LI>TrackRec.py : HELP_FILES
	<LI>wts.screens.py : gen_Help_Screens ()
	</UL>
