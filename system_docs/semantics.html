    <H2>Semantics for fields on WTS: Tracking Record Query Form</H2>
  </CENTER>

  <H3>Text fields:</H3>

  Text fields <I>(excluding those for tracking record numbers)</I> currently
  allow the user to enter a single word or phrase
  which must appear somewhere in the given field.  (The system adds a <i>%</I>
  to each end of the string and uses a sql <i>like</i> clause.)<P>
  The <I>TR #</I> field accepts a single tracking record number, a
  comma-separated list of tracking record numbers, a range of tracking record
  numbers identified with a hyphen (or .. or ...), or a combination thereof.
  (for example:
  0001, 3, 5 - 0010, 0015)  Leading zeroes are optional, and the 'TR' prefix is
  implied; the user only needs to type the integer portion of the TR #.
  It is also valid to omit either the starting or stopping TR #,
  to represent 'all before X' or 'all after X'.  (open ended ranges)<P>

  <H3>Controlled vocabularies:</H3>

  Whenever multiple items are selected from a controlled vocabulary field,
  the search is conducted using a logical OR relationship with those values.
  For example, selecting both <I>small</I> and <I>medium</I> in the Size box
  would look for tracking records of either small or medium size.<P>

  For many controlled vocabularies, there is an <I>any</I> option.  Selecting
  only this option will allow any value for that field to appear in the query
  results.  However, selecting another option along with <I>any</I> will cause
  the <I>any</I> to be ignored.  For example, selecting <I>any</I> and
  <I>small</I> will only display projects with a <I>small</I> size.<P>

  For several controlled vocabularies, there is also a checkbox for "Not".
  Clicking that checkbox and selecting one or more items from the vocab list
  will look for tracking records which have values other than those selected.<P>

  <H3>Dates and times:</H3>

  A single datetime value may be entered in a variety of formats, although
  only dates are recognized on the query form (no times).  The following are all
  valid representations for the first day of June this year:
	<UL><LI>6/1/98<LI>June 1, 1998<LI>1 Jun 98<LI>6/1/1998</UL>
  In this query form, the user is not able to enter times.  When a date is
  entered, it is assumed to include that entire day.  The user may also
  specify a range of dates by separating two dates with - or .. or ... .
  It is also valid to omit either the starting or stopping date,
  to represent 'all before X' or 'all after X'.  (open ended ranges)  For
  example, the following are all valid entries in a date query field:
  <UL><LI>6/11/97 .. June 30, 1997<LI>06/01/97 ... 7/1/97<LI>June 1, 1997
    <LI>.. 6/1/97<LI>8/5/97...</UL>
  <I>Notes:<P>
  ... for two-digit years (yy), yy is interpreted as 19yy if yy >= 90, and
  as 20yy otherwise<P>
  ... datetime fields returned by a query will be displayed using
  the format: mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm PM</I>
