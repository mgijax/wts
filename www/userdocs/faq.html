<OL>
    <LI><B><a name="brackets">How can I display angle brackets ( &lt; &gt; ) in
    	a tracking record?</a></B><P>
	Several characters have special meaning to HTML, including &amp;, &gt;,
	and &lt;.  When browser receives these characters, it attempts to
	"interpret" them -- it tries to use their special meaning.  If you just
	want them to appear as-is in your tracking record, you need to send out
	a special code instead.  Just use the code from the following table
	whenever you want one of those characters:<P>
	<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=5>
	  <TR><TH>To see a...<TH>Type in a...
	  <TR><TD>&lt;<TD>&amp;lt;
	  <TR><TD>&gt;<TD>&amp;gt;
	  <TR><TD>&amp;<TD>&amp;amp;
	</TABLE><P><HR>
    <LI><B><a name="MSIE">Should I use Microsoft Internet Explorer to access
	WTS?</a></B><P>
	In general, <I>no</I>.  IE has a few quirks when editing tracking
	records that could make it difficult for you.  Due to the way IE
	caches web pages, you could experience problems with locking tracking
	records.  IE also will not automatically reload the detail page of an
	edited tracking record.<P>
	If all you do is query and display tracking records, then you could
	probably use MS IE.  If you do any editing, however, it would be better
	to use Netscape.<P><HR>
    <LI><B><a name="tr.display.cgi">How can I link to the detailed display of a
	tracking record?</a></B><P>
	If you want to link to the detailed display of a tracking record from
	within the Project Definition or Progress Notes field of another
	tracking record, you can use the <I>tr.detail.cgi</I> script.  It takes
	one parameter named "TR_Nr" which specifies the number of the tracking
	record to which we want to link.  (The "TR_Nr" is case insensitive.)<P>
	For example, to link to the detailed display for TR 37, you could use:
	<P>
	&lt;A HREF="tr.detail.cgi?TR_Nr=37"&gt; See the detailed display of
	TR 37 &lt;/A&gt;
	<P><HR>
    <LI><B><a name="dir.cgi1">How can I link to the project directory of a
	tracking record?</a></B><P>
	If you want to link to the project directory of a tracking record from
	within the Project Definition or Progress Notes field of a tracking
	record, you can use the <I>dir.cgi</I> script.  It takes two parameters,
	both of which have case-insensitive names.  The first parameter, named
	"TR_Nr", specifies the number of the tracking record whose project
	directory we want to view.  The second parameter, "doc" is not used in
	this scenario.<P>
	For example, to link to the project directory for TR 37, you could use:
	<P>
	&lt;A HREF="dir.cgi?TR_Nr=37"&gt; See the project directory for TR 37
	&lt;/A&gt;
	<P><HR>
    <LI><B><a name="dir.cgi2">How can I link to a file in the project directory
	of a tracking record?<a/></B><P>
	If you want to link to a file in the project directory of a tracking
	record from within the Project Definition or Progress Notes field of a
	tracking record, you can use the <I>dir.cgi</I> script.  It takes two
	parameters, both of which have case-insensitive names.  The first
	parameter, named "TR_Nr", specifies the number of the tracking record
	whose project directory we want to look in.  The second parameter, "doc"
	specifies the name of the file (case sensitive) to open.<P>
	For example, to link to the requirements.html file in the project
	directory for TR 37, you could use:
	<P>
	&lt;A HREF="dir.cgi?TR_Nr=37&amp;doc=requirements.html"&gt; See the
	requirements doc for TR 37 &lt;/A&gt;
	<P><HR>
    <LI><B><a name="cannedQueries">How can I preserve common queries, so I won't
	need to compose them from the Query Form each time?</a></B><P>
	It is now possible to do any query as a GET submission; that is, you
	can do a query with all the parameters specified in a URL.  Then, you
	may bookmark that URL or add it to a web page that you maintain.<P>
	The base URL for doing a query is:
<PRE>
	http://titan/wts/searches/tr.query.results.cgi
</PRE>
	You may then add fields and values after that base URL.  The first
	specification should be preceded by a question mark (?), while others
	are preceded by an ampersand (&amp;).  For example:
<PRE>
	http://titan/wts/searches/tr.query.results.cgi?Staff=jsb&Status=new
</PRE>
	Possible fields are indicated in the table below.  Please note that no
	spaces are allowed, and that all field values are case-insensitive.<P>
	<TABLE border>

	</TABLE><P>
	For example, to retrieve tracking records which are not done, cancelled,
	or merged, and which are software fixes on the web, we could do:<P>
	http://titan/wts/searches/tr.query.results.cgi?Not=Status&Status=done,cancelled,merged&Type=swFix&Area=wi
	<P><HR>
    <LI><B><a name="batchIO">How can I make changes to many tracking records
	without stopping to edit each individually?</a></B><P>
	As a result of changes made for tracking records
	<a href="../searches/tr.detail.cgi?TR_Nr=814">814</a>,
	<a href="../searches/tr.detail.cgi?TR_Nr=815">815</a>, and
	<a href="../searches/tr.detail.cgi?TR_Nr=816">816</a>, it is now possible to
	do "batches" of input and output with WTS.  This could be a tremendous
	timesaver when you need to do things like set the Status of all the
	tracking records in a release to "done".<P>
	The typical way to make changes using a batch is:
	<OL>
	<LI>On the Query Form, set up a query which shows the fields you may
		want to change, and which returns a desired set of TRs.
	<LI>On the Query Results page, check off those TRs you want to change,
		and click the "As Text" button.
	<LI>Use the <I>File | Save As...</I> option to save the tab-delimited
		file that is generated.
	<LI>Use your favorite editor to edit that tab-delimited file.
	<LI>If the file is not already available from titan, use ftp or fetch
		to put it somewhere under your home directory.
	<LI>Login to titan via rsh or telnet.
	<LI>Change to the directory containing the tab-delimited file.
	<LI>Use the "<CODE>wts --batchInput &lt;filename&gt;</CODE>" option
		of the command line interface to load the file.
	<LI>Data lines without errors will have their changes committed to WTS.
	<LI>For data lines with errors, the error messages will be sent to
		stderr with the format:
<PRE>
	&lt;date & time of error&gt;
	&lt;data line which caused the error&gt;
	&lt;error messages, one per line&gt;
 	&lt;blank line&gt;
</PRE>
	<LI>Edit the data file to fix any errors, and re-run the
	"<CODE>wts --batchInput &lt;filename&gt;</CODE>" command.
	</OL><P>
	Notes:
	<OL>
	<LI>Changes made to the Directory, Modification Date,
		Project Definition, and Progress Notes fields are ignored.
	<LI>If a field is allowed multiple values (Area, Type, Staff, and
		Requested By), you may add or delete values by using a + or
		- before each.
	<LI>If you use a + or - for at least one item in a field's value, then
		you must use a + or - before each value specified.
	<LI>If you do not use a + or - when specifying a field's value, the old
		value will be replaced by a specified value.
	<LI>If you do not specify a value for a field, there will be no change
		to that field.
	<LI>It is possible to use a single data line for several TRs by using
		a comma-separated list of TR numbers.
	<LI>TR Nr should always be the leftmost field in the file.
	</OL><P>
	As an example, consider the following data file:
<PRE>
	TR Nr	Status	Staff
	500	done	-jsb, +rpp, +gtc
	501	new
	502,503		jcg, gld, pm
</PRE>
	When this data file is batch loaded, the following changes occur:
	<UL>
	<LI>TR500 will have its Status set to "done", and will remove
		"jsb" from the Staff field, while adding "rpp" and "gtc".
	<LI>TR501 will have its Status set to "new", with no Staff changes.
	<LI>TR502 will set its Staff field to be "jcg, gld, pm", with no change
		in Status.
	<LI>TR503 will set its Staff field to be "jcg, gld, pm", with no change
		in Status.
	</UL>
	<P><HR>
    <LI><B><a name="commandLine">How can I use the command-line interface?</a>
	</B><P>
	The command-line interface is run on titan.  It requires that two
	environment variables be set properly:
	<PRE>
	WTS_PATH	/mgi/all/wts
	SYBASE		/opt/sybase
	</PRE>
	If you want to run the command-line interface from outside the
	$WTS_PATH/admin directory, you can add $WTS_PATH/admin to your path.<P>

	The command-line interface allows you to choose an editor for WTS by
	specifying its full path in the WTS_EDITOR environment variable.  If
	that isn't defined, WTS looks for the EDITOR environment variable.  It
	that is not defined either, it defaults to using 'vi'.<P>

	Simply invoking <I>wts</I> with no arguments will give you the usage
	options, of which there are currently sixteen:<P>
	<OL>
	<LI><I>wts --addNote &lt;tr #&gt;</I><BR>
		Starts up your editor to let you type in the text of a
		Progress Note.  When you save and exit the editor, WTS will
		ask if you want to append the new entry to the Progress Notes.
		WTS will prefix the note with a header line containing the
		date, time, and username before adding it to the Progress
		Notes.
		<P>
	<LI><I>wts --addNoteFromFile &lt;tr #&gt;</I>
			&lt;full path to file&gt;<BR>
		Reads the specified file and adds its contents to the
		specified TR's Progress Notes.
		WTS will prefix the note with a header line containing the
		date, time, and username before adding it to the Progress
		Notes.
		<P>
	<LI><I>wts --batchInput &lt;filename&gt;</I><BR>
		Specifies a tab-delimited file to be read, parsed, and
		processed as a batch of changes to multiple TRs.  (Discussed
		in more detail in a separate FAQ entry)<P>
	<LI><I>wts --dir &lt;tr #&gt;</I><BR>
		Finds and prints the name of the project directory for the
		specified tracking record number.<P>
	<LI><I>wts --display &lt;tr #&gt;</I><BR>
		Displays a text representation of the tracking record with the
		specified number.<P>
	<LI><I>wts --edit &lt;tr #&gt;</I><BR>
		Loads the specified tracking record, sends a text
		representation of it to a file, starts up your editor, and loads
		in that file for you.  Once you are done editing and quit the
		editor, WTS asks if you want to import the new info from the
		file back into the database.<P>
	<LI><I>wts --fixTC &lt;tr #&gt;</I><BR>
		Checks and (if there are problems) fixes the transitive closure
		stored for the Depends On field for all tracking records related
		to the one specified.<P>
	<LI><I>wts --getField &lt;fieldname&gt; &lt;tr #&gt;</I><BR>
		Sends to stdout the value of the requested fieldname for the
		given TR.<P>
	<LI><I>wts --locks</I><BR>
		Displays a text table giving information about all the
		tracking records which are currently locked.<P>
	<LI><I>wts --new</I><BR>
		Creates a blank tracking record, sends a text representation of
		it to a file, starts up your editor, and loads in that file for
		you.  Once you are done editing and quit the editor, WTS asks
		if you want to import the new info from the file back into the
		database.  Note that nothing is saved to the database unless
		you decide (Yes) to import the information.<P>
	<LI><I>wts --plainTree &lt;tr #&gt;</I><BR>
		Sends to stdout a text representation of a tree showing all
		the dependencies under the specified tracking record, with
		only the TR # shown for each.<P>
	<LI><I>wts --queryTitle &lt;query string&gt;</I><BR>
		Allows you to query for a certain string in the Title field.
		Sends to stdout a comma-separated list of TR numbers with
		Titles which contain the specified string.<P>
	<LI><I>wts --routing</I><BR>
		Allows you to change the e-mail addresses and Areas associated
		with the various routing categories.<P>
	<LI><I>wts --setField &lt;fieldname&gt; &lt;tr #&gt; &lt;field
			value&gt;</I><BR>
		Replaces the current value of the named field in the given TR
		with the value specified.  This is especially useful for
		setting Status entries.  When dealing with multi-valued
		controlled vocabulary fields, you may preface entries with a
		+ to add them to the current list, or preface them with a -
		to remove them from the current list.  (Rules follow those
		given for the <CODE>--batchInput</CODE> option above.)<P>
	<LI><I>wts --tree &lt;tr #&gt;</I><BR>
		Sends to stdout a text representation of a tree showing all
		the dependencies under the specified tracking record, with
		the TR # and Title shown for each.<P>
	<LI><I>wts --unlock &lt;tr #&gt;</I><BR>
		Unlocks the tracking record with the specified key, no matter
		who has it locked for editing.  This should only be used when
		you know that a lock has persisted in error.<P>
